Source code for "Deep Joint Entity Disambiguation with Local Neural Attention", O-E. Ganea and T. Hofmann, accepted at EMNLP 2017.

Full code will be released before 20th September. Meanwhile, we released the code and data (link below) to load the mention - entity index.

Entity embeddings trained with our method using Word2Vec 300 dimensional pre-trained word vectors (GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin). They have norm 1 and are restricted only to entities appearing in the training, validation and test sets described in our paper. Available here: https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/sH2JSB2c1OSj7yv .
