Source code for "Deep Joint Entity Disambiguation with Local Neural Attention"

Code coming soon.

Entity embeddings trained with our method using Word2Vec 300 dimensional pre-trained word vectors (GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin). They have norm 1 and are restricted only to entities appearing in the training, validation and test sets described in Wikipedia. Available here: https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/jPMfDy6H4t0JIFo
